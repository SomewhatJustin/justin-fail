            I don't even remember what this project was. I bought the domain in

            I tried to connect YouTubers with brands in order to faciliate
            sponsorships. I succesfully connected a YouTuber and a company that
            made Apple Watch accessoriesâ€”a deal worth ~$500. The company didn't
            make any money back from the ad read and I gave up. Lesson learned:
            get back up, pivot, and try again!

            What if I read tech news to you? This was a small project I started
            with an online friend. It quickly fizzled out after a lack of
            interest.

            My friends and I had a good idea: what if you could play music
            simultaneously through various devices, even if they're not
            connected? Not only were we a little ahead of our time, we also
            didn't know what we were doing. We paid a guy on Fiverr to make a
            (cringy)

            and tried to raise money on IndieGogo. We received $0.00. Rightfully
            so!

            A blog about smartphone apps. Not a complete failure, but not a fun idea. I was trying my hand at
            SEO, and I had an interest in smart phones. My heart wasn't in it.
            This was a great failure, though, because it was the spiritual
            predecssor to my YouTube channel, which I consider a success.
