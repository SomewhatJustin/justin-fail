TailwindCSS CDN Starter App
=================

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a CSS library that gives you basic components for building a website without overriding opinionated styles.

Tailwind can be used two ways: as [a package](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#1-install-tailwind-via-npm), or [via a CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-via-cdn). The CDN option means easier installation and no need to compile; but there's a more limited feature set. 

This is an example of using the CDN.
